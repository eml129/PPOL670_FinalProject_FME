<h2 id="sec-1">Introduction</h2>
<p> During his state visit to Russia, President of Angola Joao Lourenco signed several bilateral agreements to include cooperation on diamond mining and <br>
	processing.  Russian Predident Vladimir Putin welcomed his Angolan counterpart, "I am happy to welcome you to Moscow in your capacity as the <br>
	head of state. You are well acquainted with our country, because you studied here, and I hope you will find it both interesting and pleasant <br>
	to see how Moscow and Russia have changed" (The Kremlin 2019). Indeed, President Lourenco attended the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Military-Political <br>
	Academy in 1978 (Cascais 2017). Certainly, President Lourenco is not the only African leader who has received military training abroad. Pictured <br>
	below, Eritrean President Isaias poses with his fellow military students in 1967 China (Bodetti 2020).

Foreign military education and training occurs when a sponsoring state, state A, provides military education or training to military service members <br>
	from a recipient state, state B. Foreign military education is one tool that states use to influence other states' military elites, and by <br>
	extension, other states’ foreign policy alignment (Barkawi 2011). In an era, to which many scholars and policymakers refer to as the return of <br>
	great power competition (e.g., Kroenig 2020; Hoffman 2021), what do the foreign military education networks of today’s African heads of state and <br>
	military leadership tell us about great power influence on the continent? </p>
