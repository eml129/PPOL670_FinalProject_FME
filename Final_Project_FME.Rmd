# Introduction
During his state visit to Russia, President of Angola Joao Lourenco signed
several bilateral agreements to include cooperation on diamond mining and 
processing.  Russian Predident Vladimir Putin welcomed his Angolan counterpart, "I am happy to welcome you to Moscow in your capacity as the head of state. You are well acquainted with our country, because you studied here, and I hope 
you will find it both interesting and pleasant to see how Moscow and Russia 
have changed" (The Kremlin 2019). Indeed, President Lourenco attended the 
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Military-Political Academy in 1978 (Cascais 2017). Certainly, President Lourenco is not the only African leader who has received military training abroad. Pictured below, Eritrean President Isaias poses with his fellow military students in 1967 China (Bodetti 2020).

Foreign military education and training occurs when a sponsoring state, state A, provides military education or training to military service members from a recipient state, state B.  Foreign military education is one tool that states use to influence other states' military elites, and by extension, other states’ foreign policy alignment (Barkawi 2011). In an era, to which many scholars and policymakers refer to as the return of great power competition (e.g., Kroenig
2020; Hoffman 2021), **what do the foreign military education networks of today’s African heads of state and military leadership tell us about great power influence on the continent?**

# Foreign Military Education (FME) Data
Using official government and newspaper sources, we compiled a list of 106 current African heads of state (Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Kings) and military elites (Minister of Defense, Chief of the Armed Forces, or Chief of a Military Service) who received military training during their careers.  Out of these 106 leaders, 90 participated in foreign military education courses sponsored by 47 different countries.  The US provided the FME to the most African leaders followed by France, Great Britain, Russia, and China.  Nigeria is the most influential African FME sponsor having trained 11 African leaders outside of Nigeria.

```{r descriptive information}
FME <- read_csv("FME.csv") %>%
  filter(Military_Experience == "1")

FME_Sponsor_Sum <- FME %>%
  select(FME_USA:FME_Singapore) %>%
  summarise(across(FME_USA:FME_Singapore, sum))

FME_Sponsor_Short <- FME_Sponsor_Sum %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
  select(FME_USA, FME_France, FME_UK, FME_USSR_Russia, FME_China, FME_Nigeria) %>%
  pivot_longer(FME_USA:FME_Nigeria, names_to = "sponsor", values_to = "total")


FME_Sponsor_Short %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x= total, y = reorder(sponsor, total), fill = sponsor), stat="identity", width = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("FME_USA" = "USA", "FME_France" = "France",
                              "FME_UK" = "UK", "FME_USSR_Russia" = "USSR/Russia",
                              "FME_Nigeria" = "Nigeria")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey", "grey", "grey", "grey", "blue", "grey")) +
  labs(
    title="The US Provides FME to the Most African Leaders",
        x ="Number of African Leaders Trained", 
    y = "Sponsoring Country") +
